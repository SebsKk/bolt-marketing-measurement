    "- There are several cities which could be grouped together based on ride patterns and trends as well as demographics\n",
    "- Some cities display higher variation in their ride distibutions which could be attributed to seasonality\n",
    "- Due to this we could decide to either use DiD as out impact measurement framework which leverages data from before campaign launch well and accounts for pre existing differences between the cities\n",
    "- MMM could also be a valid choice due to the nature of Bolt as a company as it considers other marketing channels and external factors \n",
    "- Some supporting metrics such as ROI, Customer Acquisition Cost or iCPA are also a must to analyze to understand the bigger picture and effecitveness of the campaign\n",
    "- The Snapchat campaign seems to have made little difference so the 5000 Euro budget might have been too little or the medium/ campaign content/ campaign location might have not been the most effective"
