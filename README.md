# Bolt Marketing Measurement 


**Project Overview**
This project aims to evaluate the impact of the new advertising channel, TweetX, on ride numbers in various cities in Poland. The task involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), setting up a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis framework, and implementing a Mixed Market Modelling (MMM) approach. The goal is to determine the best way to measure the impact of the campaign, the minimal budget required for significant results, and the optimal measurement design.


**Notebooks Overview**

BoltEDA.ipynb - Analyzed ride patterns, distributions among cities, seasonality effects, and correlation effects. Provided insights into the baseline trends and identified potential outliers

impact_measurement_framework_did.ipynb - The DiD method compares changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group (cities with TweetX campaign) and a control group (cities without TweetX). Also went through with a short analysis of the Snapchat campaign

impact_measurement_framework_mmm.ipynb - proposition of the MMM model as a model of measurement

udget_and_design_recommendations.ipynb - calculations to get the proposed minimal model for the TweetX campaign
